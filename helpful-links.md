visibility: hidden - hides the element by changing its opacity to 0

Whenever we specify position as sticky|fixed, we need to justify from where it is sticky and hence we define properties such as top:0, left:0 etc

When you define position:absolute, we can use `top-0 right-0 left-0 bottom-0`

grid is same as flex flex-col

htmlFor in <label> triggers the input field given they both have the same ID
